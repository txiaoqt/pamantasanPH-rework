# Newsletter - Handler Function (`handleSubmit`)

This document details the `handleSubmit` function utilized within the `Newsletter` component. This function is responsible for processing the newsletter subscription form submission.

## Handler Function

### `handleSubmit`
```typescript
const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission behavior
  
  // In a real application, this would involve an API call to a backend service
  // to handle the actual subscription (e.g., saving the email to a database).
  console.log('Newsletter subscription:', email); // Placeholder for actual logic

  setEmail(''); // Clear the email input field after submission
};
```
- **Parameters:** `e`: `React.FormEvent` - The event object generated by the form submission.
- **Functionality:**
    1.  **Prevent Default Behavior:** `e.preventDefault()` is called to stop the browser's default form submission action, which would typically cause a page reload.
    2.  **Log Email (Placeholder):** Currently, it logs the `email` state (the value from the input field) to the console.
    - **Note:** This is explicitly a placeholder. In a production application, this section would contain asynchronous logic to send the email address to a backend API endpoint for actual subscription processing (e.g., adding the email to a mailing list, saving it to a database).
    3.  **Clear Input:** Calls `setEmail('')` to clear the email input field, providing a clean slate for the user after submission.
- **Purpose:** To manage the user's interaction with the newsletter subscription form. It captures the user's email and simulates (or initiates) the subscription process.
- **Triggered by:** The `onSubmit` event of the `<form>` element, which occurs when the user clicks the "Subscribe" button or presses Enter within the email input field.
