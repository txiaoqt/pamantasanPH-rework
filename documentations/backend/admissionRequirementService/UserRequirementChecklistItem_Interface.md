# AdmissionRequirementService - `UserRequirementChecklistItem` Interface

This document describes the `UserRequirementChecklistItem` interface, which defines the structure for a single entry in a user's admission requirement checklist within the UniCentral application. This interface is crucial for representing and managing the progress of individual admission requirements for specific universities.

## Interface Definition

```typescript
export interface UserRequirementChecklistItem {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  university_id: number;
  requirement_text: string;
  is_completed: boolean;
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp
  updated_at: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

## Properties

### `id`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** A unique identifier for this specific checklist item. This is typically a UUID generated by the database upon creation.

### `user_id`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** The unique identifier (UUID) of the user who owns this checklist item. This links the requirement to a specific user.

### `university_id`
- **Type:** `number`
- **Description:** The unique numerical identifier of the university to which this requirement pertains. This links the requirement to a specific university.

### `requirement_text`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** The full text description of the admission requirement (e.g., "Submit application form", "Provide transcript of records"). This field is part of the composite primary key used for `onConflict` in `upsert` operations.

### `is_completed`
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Description:** A flag indicating whether the user has marked this specific requirement as completed (`true`) or not (`false`).

### `created_at`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** An ISO-formatted timestamp indicating when this checklist item was first created in the database.

### `updated_at`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** An ISO-formatted timestamp indicating the last time this checklist item was updated in the database.

## Usage
The `UserRequirementChecklistItem` interface is used by the `AdmissionRequirementService` to type the data fetched from or sent to the `user_requirement_checklist` table in Supabase. Frontend components consuming this service will receive data conforming to this interface to display and manage user checklists.
